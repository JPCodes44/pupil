This application is now fully functional, but we will continue to improve upon it! Feel free to message us at j29mak@uwaterloo.ca or mk2athan@uwaterloo.ca for any suggestions/feedback!

For testing, make sure your Flutter environment is installed properly. Dependencies will request to install upon running the app in your preffered IDE, tested and working in VS Code with an iOS simulator and wired connection, as well as through XCode. Make sure you have the latest version of Ruby installed as well as Cocoapods. Additional documentation on running flutter apps can be found here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
